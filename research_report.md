**Revised Research Report: Common Problems and Challenges Faced by Individuals and Organizations**

## Introduction

The purpose of this research report is to identify and document the common problems and challenges faced by individuals and organizations in various fields. The report is based on a comprehensive review of problem statements from the CodeMate Hackathon Problem Statements document.

## Problem Statements

The following problem statements are identified as common challenges faced by individuals and organizations:

### Problem Statement 1: Python-Based Command Terminal

Develop a fully functioning command terminal that mimics the behavior of a real system terminal. The backend of this terminal must be built in Python, and it should be able to execute standard commands and return accurate outputs.

**Key Challenges:**

* Replicating the low-level behavior of a traditional terminal in a Python environment while ensuring efficiency, correctness, and extensibility.
* Meeting the following mandatory requirements:
	+ A Python backend to process and execute commands.
	+ Support for full-fledged file and directory operations.
	+ Error handling for invalid commands.
	+ Clean and responsive interface.
	+ Integration with system monitoring tools.
* Optional enhancements:
	+ AI-driven terminal where users can type natural language queries.
	+ Command history and auto-completion.

### Problem Statement 2: PR (Pull Request) Review Agent

Build an AI-powered agent capable of reviewing pull requests across any git server. The agent should analyze code changes and provide constructive feedback for improvements.

**Key Challenges:**

* Creating a general-purpose agent that works with any git server and can understand diverse codebases.
* Meeting the following mandatory requirements:
	+ Compatibility with multiple git servers.
	+ Feedback generation on code structure, standards, and possible bugs.
	+ Written in Python with a modular structure.
* Optional enhancements:
	+ AI-driven feedback with automated suggestions.
	+ Inline review comments similar to GitHub or GitLab review systems.
	+ Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated pre-merge reviews.
	+ Scoring system to grade PRs on code quality.

### Problem Statement 3: Deep Researcher Agent

Create a deep researcher agent that can search, analyze, and synthesize information from large-scale data sources. The solution must not rely on external web search APIs, instead, it should handle local embedding generation and reasoning.

**Key Challenges:**

* Building a high-scale system that can effectively gather, process, and retrieve relevant information without depending on external APIs.
* Meeting the following mandatory requirements:
	+ Python-based system for query handling and response generation.
	+ Local embedding generation for document indexing and retrieval.
	+ Support for multi-step reasoning to break down queries into smaller tasks.
	+ Efficient storage and retrieval pipeline.
* Optional enhancements:
	+ Summarization of multiple sources into a coherent research report.
	+ Interactive query refinement where the user can ask follow-up questions.
	+ AI-powered assistant that explains reasoning steps.
	+ Export of research results in structured formats.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the common problems and challenges faced by individuals and organizations in various fields include:

* Replicating the low-level behavior of a traditional terminal in a Python environment while ensuring efficiency, correctness, and extensibility.
* Creating a general-purpose agent that works with any git server and can understand diverse codebases.
* Building a high-scale system that can effectively gather, process, and retrieve relevant information without depending on external APIs.

These challenges require innovative solutions that can be developed using Python and other technologies. The problem statements provide a clear direction for researchers and developers to work towards solving these challenges.
